#1 Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
● Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● Task submission:

Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in a video. Post the video on YouTube
Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn profile
Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.

#5 To Explore Business Analytics
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)

#3 Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
